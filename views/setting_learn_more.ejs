        <h2>Anigram</h2>
        <p>
          Anigram is a responsive web application inspired by Instagram, focused
          on showcasing interactive animal profiles. It allows users to sign up,
          browse, and manage various animal profiles in a social media-like
          environment, with features designed to emulate an Instagram
          experience.
        </p>

                features.

            <ul>
              <li>
                The home page displays a randomized collection of posts from
                <code>posts.json</code>, representing interactions between
                animal profiles.
              </li>

                Users can view their own or other animal profiles, each
                featuring customizable photos and bios. An error page is shown
                if a profile doesn’t exist or the username is incorrect.
              </li>
              <li>

                with autocomplete suggestions as they type.

                The settings page (<code>/ig/settings</code>) provides options,

            <ul>
              <li>
                Users can delete posts within their profile, which resets the
                session and requires a re-login to regain access.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technical Overview:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Node.js, Express, EJS for
            templating, <code>express-session</code> for session management, and
            JSON files (<code>data.json</code> for user data and
            <code>posts.json</code> for posts).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Session Management:</strong> Sessions maintain user
            authentication, ensuring only logged-in users can access features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Management:</strong> Utility functions handle reading
            and writing from JSON files, supporting dynamic profile and post
            management.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Anigram is designed as a demo for an animal-focused social platform
          and is planned to expand with more features, transforming it into a
          fully interactive Instagram-like experience.
